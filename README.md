# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application (Twitter Clone)

This is the sample application for
[*Learn Web Development: The Ruby on Rails
Tutorial*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).


I already made this once, but that was around a year ago and the version now is using a different version of Rails so I thought to give it a go.  And as it is still a draft, I thought to check it out in case I find a few typos or something else.  Would like to help Hartl myself as I used his tutorial to get me started on Rails.
